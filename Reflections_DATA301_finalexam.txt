Method Chaining in Python was a topic I found really interesting because of its ability to organize the code to process and
wrangle data. Method chaining is when we modify a dataframe using a "chain" of pandas methods. The top to bottom execution
makes the code very readable and understandable, all while running complex functions.

Example 1:
Exploratory Data Analyses have allowed me to understand how data is better understood and visualized in a way that benefits
organizations and scientists. Extracting relevant information, wrangling data to better suit certain needs, and visualizing
dataframes have given me an understanding of what a future career might look like in data science.

Example 2:
Learning Python was a valuable lesson taught to me in this course because of its ability to process data in a way that's
readable. I never understood the reason to use Python, but now that I know its application to certain fields I will
definitely continue learning and expanding my knowledge with it.

Example 3:
Dashboards are very useful when it comes to displaying information to the public. People who may not be able to read a
complete EDA may need assistance of organized visualizations and explanations. This was valuable to learn since I will
be working in a field where the communication of data to people who aren't educated with data science is common everyday.

Deserved grade:
I believe the work that I have done in this course has earned me a 90% evaluation. My background with programming was useful
in understanding new concepts with data science, as I was able to apply my experience and grasp a deep understanding of them
quickly. I worked on approaching
The work I have done in the labs and the knowledge I've demonstrated on the tests earn me this evaluation, however my
incompletion of select assignments over the semester may not backup this claim.
